## Personal details and Skills

I devoted more than 10 years to business consulting, after which I decided to radically change my profession. I studied Java on GeekBrains courses, as well as on my own on various platforms such as HackerRank, CodingBat, JavaRush.  
Area of my interests: full-stack development of web applications using Java, Spring and modern UI technologies.  
Here is a simple block of js code (to show markdown styles):

```javascript
const myName = 'Denis';
function greeting(name) {
    console.log("Hello, I am %s", name);
}
greeting(myName);
```
